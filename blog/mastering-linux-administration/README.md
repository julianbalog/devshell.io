Mastering Linux Administration
==============================

https://devshell.io/mastering-linux-administration/

In a new book from Packt Publishing I co-wrote with [Alex Calcatinge](https://devopsroot.com/mastering-linux-administration/), we take a fresh look at Linux administration from the perspective of recent transformations in the modern data center, with workloads spanning from on-premises to public cloud infrastructures. To quote from the book's introductory notes:

> There's an evolutionary twist to the making of a modern-day Linux administrator. Tedious manual administrative operations are gradually replaced by orchestrated and automated workflows. One-off magic commands and scripts are replaced by declarative manifests invoked on-demand while scaling up or down system configurations based on computing needs. Yesterday's Linux administrator progressively morphs into a DevOps persona.

[Mastering Linux Administration](https://packt.live/3gNfXZp) is written with the Admin turned DevOps in mind.
